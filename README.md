## The Files
<h3>general</h3>
<p>
  Every platform has its own folder. One for web, one for desktop, one for ios and one for android.
</p>
<p>
  The folder called "src" is the folder containing all functions, errors and css/styling of the application. This folder is the most important one for being able to run the application.
</p>
<p>
  Every created and already existing user is put under the folder called "u".
</p>

<h3>data</h3>
<p>
  There is still being thought about what will be used for the datastorage.
